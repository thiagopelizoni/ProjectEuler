    Purpose
    -------
    Computes and prints the sum of all strong repunits below 10^12.

    Method / Math Rationale
    ------------------------
    Strong repunits are positive integers that are repunits in at least two
    different bases greater than 1. This includes 1 (repunit in all bases with
    one digit) and all numbers that are repunits with three or more digits in
    at least one base (since all numbers >=3 are repunits with two digits in
    base n-1). The algorithm generates all repunits with length >=3 by
    iteratively building the geometric series for each base starting from 2,
    adding unique values below the limit to the sum.

    Complexity
    ----------
    The outer loop runs up to approximately 10^6 bases, with inner loops
    averaging O(1) for large bases and up to O(log limit) for small bases,
    resulting in overall time complexity O(sqrt(limit) log limit) â‰ˆ O(10^6).
