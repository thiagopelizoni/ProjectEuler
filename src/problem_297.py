    Purpose
    Solve Project Euler problem 297: find the sum of z(n) for 1 <= n < 10^{17}, where z(n) is the number of terms
    in the Zeckendorf representation of n.

    Method / Math Rationale
    Uses a memoized recursive function to compute the sum. For a given n, find the largest Fibonacci f_k <= n.
    The sum up to n is the sum up to f_k - 1 plus the contributions from f_k to n, which is (m_max + 1) +
    sum_z(m_max), where m_max = n - f_k.
    The Fibonacci sequence is generated starting with 1 and 2 as per the problem.

    Complexity
    With memoization, the time complexity is O(L^2) in the worst case, where L â‰ˆ 84 is the number of Fibonacci
    numbers up to 10^{17}, but in practice much faster.
