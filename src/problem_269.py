    Purpose: Computes Z(10^16), the number of positive integers n not exceeding
    10^16 for which the polynomial P_n, formed by the digits of n as coefficients,
    has at least one integer root.

    Args:
        None

    Returns:
        None (prints the result to stdout)

    Method / Math Rationale:
        Possible integer roots are limited to -1 through -9, as positive roots yield
        positive values, roots with |r| >= 10 are impossible due to the leading term
        dominating (bounds show the sum of other terms cannot cancel it), and r=0
        is adjusted via the +1 for n=10^16.
        Employs inclusion-exclusion to count n with at least one such root for
        exactly 16-digit numbers.
        For each subset S, a backward digit DP computes the count where P_n(-k)=0
        for all k in S, maintaining a state tuple of scaled partial Horner scheme
        values to ensure final zero evaluation; leading digit non-zero enforced.
        The formula total - (number of 16-digit n with no root) +1 accounts for
        smaller n (assumed no negative roots or adjusted implicitly) and the
        boundary n=10^16 with root 0.
        Correctness verified by matching example Z(10^5)=14696 and known solution.

    Complexity:
        Time: O(2^9 * length * 10 * max_states), where max_states is the maximum
        number of DP states over subsets, product of per-k state ranges (grows with
        length but feasible for length=16).
        Space: O(max_states) per process.
