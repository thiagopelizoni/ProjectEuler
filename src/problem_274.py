    Purpose
    Solves Project Euler problem 274 by computing the sum of divisibility multipliers
    for all primes less than 10^7 that are coprime to 10.

    Args
    None

    Returns
    None

    Method / Math Rationale
    The divisibility multiplier m for each qualifying prime p is the modular inverse
    of 10 modulo p, since this satisfies the condition that n is divisible by p if
    and only if the transformed number (n // 10) + (n % 10) * m is divisible by p.
    The function uses sympy's primerange to generate primes from 3 to 10^7 - 1,
    skips p=5, computes the inverse using Python's built-in pow function, and
    accumulates the sum.

    Complexity
    O(N log log N) for generating primes up to N=10^7 using the sieve, plus O(Ï€(N))
    for iterating over approximately 664,579 primes, which is negligible.
